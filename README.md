## Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    (https://github.com/Sunnysain/Paris_Olympic_PowerBI_Dashboard.git)
    ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install kaggle pandas
    ```

3. **Set up Kaggle API**:
    - Sign up on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and create a new API token.
    - Download `kaggle.json` and place it in your system’s `.kaggle` directory.

4. **Run the Python script to download the dataset**:
    - The dataset will be automatically downloaded and saved in your specified directory. 📥

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Data Acquisition**: The Python script connects to the Kaggle API to download the **Paris 2024 Olympic dataset**, which includes information on athletes, events, medals, schedules, and more.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Once the data is downloaded, it’s processed and organized into **Pandas DataFrames** for easy access and analysis.
3. **Visualization in Power BI**: Import the prepared data into **Power BI** using Python scripts and create interactive dashboards and reports to explore trends and insights.

## Visualizations 📊
Here are some of the key visualizations included in the Power BI dashboard:
- **Athlete Participation by Country, Gender, Medal Category, and Type**:
  - **Bar Chart**: Display the number of athletes from each country, broken down by gender, medal category (Gold, Silver, Bronze), and medal type (e.g., individual, team).
  
- **Medal Count by Country, Gender, Medal Category, and Type**:
  - **Pie Chart**: Visualize the total number of medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze) by each country, broken down by gender and medal category.
  
- **Event Schedule**: A detailed table of events, dates, and venues.
- **Torch Route Map**: A map visualizing the Olympic torch route across France.
- **Medal Trends Over Time**: A line chart showing trends in medals won over the years, broken down by country or sport.

### Sample Power BI Visuals:
1. **Athlete Participation by Country, Gender, and Medal Category**:  
   This **bar chart** shows the number of athletes participating from each country, split by **gender** (Male, Female) and **medal category** (Gold, Silver, Bronze). This provides an overview of representation and participation across genders and medal types for each country.

2. **Medal Counts by Country, Gender, and Medal Category**:  
   A **pie chart** showing the total medals won by each country, broken down by **gender** (Male, Female) and **medal category** (Gold, Silver, Bronze). This helps to identify top-performing countries across various categories and medal types.

3. **Medal Trends Over Time**:  
   A **line chart** to show trends in medals won by countries over the years. This can highlight the performance trajectory of different nations across Olympic games.
